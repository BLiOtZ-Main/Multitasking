looks like you finally got in today. i wish 
you could save me the embarrassment, but i 
guess i'm going to have to go through this 
again, aren't i?

once you finish typing this prompt, you
will be clocked in and your work day will
start. you need to finish the documents you
get sent quickly, and i better not see you
playing any of that space game again^tm.

sincerely,
your sentient computer
