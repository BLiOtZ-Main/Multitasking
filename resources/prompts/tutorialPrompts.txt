start typing...welcome to multitasking!
this is the tutorial for the game. you may 
have noticed that you don't have to type 
spaces, punctuation, or make new lines. this 
is intentional! after you are finished 
typing this, the screen will split in half, 
into two games! you need to keep typing and 
playing both games simultaneously!
once you type this line the game will start!
