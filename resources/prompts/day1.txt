##monday meeting notes
chris has started bringing in stuff to cook his
own lunch every single day. no one has been able
to use the microwave during lunch hours since last
tuesday. people can just bring in sandwiches its 
no big deal.

melissa said she overheard mark bragging to chris
that he hasn’t showered in nearly two weeks. i
think that’s the least of his problems.

charles made a remark that sophia has been too
controlling during the holiday party planning
meetings. the worst party of the year is always
melissa’s birthday because she is the one who
isn’t involved in the planning, so i could care
less.
